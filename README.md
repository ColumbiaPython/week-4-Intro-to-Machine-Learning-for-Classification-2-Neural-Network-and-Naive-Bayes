# Introduction to Machine Learning for classification 2:
# Neural Network and Naive Bayes

## Neural Network
1. How to choose the activation functions in each layer of neural network?
2. What is forward and backward learning?

## Naive Bayes
1. Why Naive Bayes is naive?
2. What is the assumption of Naive Bayes?
3. What makes Naive Bayes (Bayesian) different from Statistics?
